# FruitPunch AI Code epoch 2: MNIST

AI Code is an initiative by fruitpunch where students can learn to apply AI together by solving a challenge under supervision of an expert. This repository contains the challenge files for epoch 2.

## Challenge description

This week we will continue with a similar challenge to last week: MNIST. This challenge is considered the “Hello, World!” of neural networks. You will tackle this challenge using several machine learning techniques and neural network architectures.

MNIST is a large dataset containing images of handwritten digits. The challenge is to create an algorithm that can recognise these digits with a high accuracy. In today's AI Code we challenge you to solve this in the following 4 ways:

1. Do not use machine learning.
2. Use a machine learning algorithm but not a neural network.
3. Use a fully-connected neural network.
4. Use a convolutional neural network.

This challenge is prepared by [Mehmet Alican Noyan](https://github.com/MehmetAlicanNoyan).
